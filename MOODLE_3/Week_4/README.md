# 🧾 Interactive Form with Local & Session Storage

This project is a simple web application that allows users to enter their name and age, store the data in the browser using **Local Storage**, and track interactions during a single session using **Session Storage**. It's designed as a hands-on exercise to apply your knowledge of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — especially working with the DOM and browser storage APIs.
